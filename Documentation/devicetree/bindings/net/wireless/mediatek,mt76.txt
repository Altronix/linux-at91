* MediaTek mt76xx devices

This node provides properties for configuring the MediaTek mt76xx wireless
device. The node is expected to be specified as a child node of the PCI
controller to which the wireless chip is connected.

Optional properties:

- ieee80211-freq-limit: See ieee80211.txt
- mediatek,mtd-eeprom: Specify a MTD partition + offset containing EEPROM data

The driver is using of_get_mac_address API, so the MAC address can be as well
be set with corresponding optional properties defined in net/ethernet.txt.

Optional nodes:
- led: Properties for a connected LED
  Optional properties:
    - led-sources: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
