* Atmel SDHCI controller

This file documents the differences between the core properties in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt and the properties used by the
sdhci-of-at91 driver.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "atmel,sama5d2-sdhci" or "microchip,sam9x60-sdhci".
- clocks:		Phandlers to the clocks.
- clock-names:		Must be "hclock", "multclk", "baseclk" for
			"atmel,sama5d2-sdhci".
			Must be "hclock", "multclk" for "microchip,sam9x60-sdhci".

Optional properties:
- assigned-clocks:	The same with "multclk".
- assigned-clock-rates	The rate of "multclk" in order to not rely on the
			gck configuration set by previous components.


Examples:

sdmmc0: sdio-host@a0000000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-sdhci";
	reg = <0xa0000000 0x300>;
	interrupts = <31 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 0>;
	clocks = <&sdmmc0_hclk>, <&sdmmc0_gclk>, <&main>;
	clock-names = "hclock", "multclk", "baseclk";
	assigned-clocks = <&sdmmc0_gclk>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <480000000>;
};

sdmmc0: sdio-host@80000000 {
	compatible = "microchip,sam9x60-sdhci";
	reg = <0x80000000 0x300>;
	interrupts = <12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 0>;
	clocks = <&pmc PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL 12>, <&pmc PMC_TYPE_GCK 12>;
	clock-names = "hclock", "multclk";
	assigned-clocks = <&pmc PMC_TYPE_GCK 12>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <100000000>;
};
